ADOS was co-organized by &lt;a href="https://banodoco.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banadoco&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightricks&lt;/a>, which was an ideal fit for Artifex Lab: Banadoco is the leading online community for AI art+technology and Lightricks&amp;rsquo;s LTX is the fastest generative AI video model (and it&amp;rsquo;s Open Source on top of that!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coincidentally, our team has recently been investigating LTX deeply and also has been hanging out a lot on Banadoco&amp;rsquo;s inspiring Discord server. One thing led to another and I was invited to present a keynote at ADOS. We brought most of the team, as well as a bleeding edge demo. Unfortuntately, I missed out on the second day of the event, which featured a hackathon, where our PhD student Hovhannes received a prize (see his upcoming blogpost on our &lt;a href="https://ar-ai.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team webpage&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Before reporting about the keynote and demo, I would like to highlight some of my favourite things that I saw at the event. All talks are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBeZSbaxMvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded on youtube&lt;/a>; I provide direct links to the talks in the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gBeZSbaxMvc?si=orYRKkprSBqWWwBo&amp;amp;t=468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Catnip&amp;rsquo;s talk&lt;/a>, particularly her work Bloom. It is very soulful and beautifully designed. I will never forget her bitter-sweet explanation: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the summer of love I that never had&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDUExDUYRaE" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Another very interesting artist&amp;rsquo;s talk was by &lt;a href="https://udart.dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vibeke Bertelsen (Udart)&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gBeZSbaxMvc?si=r3DAzpV5a7a7C8jd&amp;amp;t=8304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timestamp&lt;/a>. Imagine current AI tools in the hands of H.R. Giger&amp;hellip; Below is one of her award-winning short movies. Definitely most unique!&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>On the tech side, my favourite talk was by &lt;a href="https://github.com/yvann-ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yvann Barbot&lt;/a>. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gBeZSbaxMvc?si=utqO7-YM0Oq1c5Fx&amp;amp;t=8960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his talk&lt;/a>, he showed how easy it is to generate cool audio-reactive video clips using his ComfyUI nodes. One example below by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@visualfrisson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Frisson&lt;/a>. After the event, I checked Yvann&amp;rsquo;s youtube channel. I can highly recommend it!&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Finally, let me get to my keynote talk and our demo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the extreme technical difficulties involved in our demo, we were working literally till the last minute on it. Chapeau to D치vid Maruscs치k and Francesco Dettori for their very hard work near demo time! Very unfortunately, the backend of our demo stopped working 5 minutes before my talk started. As a result, we could not show the demo during my keynote (as we had originally planned), but only 2 hours later. Luckily, most attendants of ADOS were still there and could give it a try!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We demonstrate how to use a cloud backend for highspeed generation of spatial videos based on image and text inputs. You can see a similar version of the demo below; compared to the demo we showed at ADOS, it is only using 1 local RTX 4090 GPU for inference, as opposed to 4 H100 GPUs at ADOS, so inference speed is significantly lower.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gk2dtoOXDac" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>You can see my keynote on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gBeZSbaxMvc?si=qr5cMNz5WXu8Jt7d&amp;amp;t=7061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube&lt;/a>, where I speak about my long past with AR and my more recent past with AI, and how everything converged into this demo :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, I would like to sincerely thank:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com/ados" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADOS&lt;/a> organizational team: &lt;a href="https://banodoco.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banadoco&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightricks&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.artifex-lab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artifex Lab&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Special thanks to Lightricks for giving us early access to their distilled LTX model, which enabled impressive speedups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All &lt;a href="https://ar-ai.org/people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARAI team members&lt;/a> for bearing with my demands :-) Directly involved in the demo were Cyrille Leroux, Thomas Betton, D치vid Maruscs치k, Francesco Dettori, and Hovhannes Margaryan.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In this lengthy blogpost, I want to:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Explain the &lt;em>enormous work&lt;/em> that we did over the &lt;em>last 10 days&lt;/em>, resulting in a funny AI

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/nav>
&lt;/details>
&lt;p>Since my last blog post, a ton of generative AI video models have been
released and I have tested the most important ones. To be upfront with
my conclusion: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent&amp;rsquo;s Hunyuan Video&lt;/a>
is &lt;em>absolutely astonishing&lt;/em> and
will have wide impact. The last time I had this feeling was when Stable
Diffusion came out in 2022, which was the foundation for successful
commercial products such as Midjourney and is still being used widely
(e.g. the new Mountain Dew commercials are made with it). I am convinced:
&lt;em>Hunyuan will be for video generation what Stable Diffusion has been
for image generation.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-the-ideal-video-model">1. The Ideal Video Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Obviously, we want video models to be expressive and generate videos of
high resolution and framerate. Some not-so-obvious requirements include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Open source:&lt;/em> model can be downloaded and run locally&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Uncensored:&lt;/em> censored models lead to many problems&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Allow the development of an &lt;em>ecosystem of tools&lt;/em> around it&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Following the analogy to Stable Diffusion I drew earlier: all of these
were true for it and were key to why it won.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="model-censorship">Model Censorship&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In general, this is a difficult question. On the one hand, I concur that
some extreme content should simply not exist at all, so models should
not be able to generate it. On the other hand, over-censoring of models
has some unintended side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier this year, Google&amp;rsquo;s image generation model Gemini was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/technology/google-gemini-german-uniforms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely ridiculed&lt;/a> when a
prompt for &amp;ldquo;Nazi soldiers&amp;rdquo; would generate Black and Asian soldiers. When
OpenAI released DALLE in 2022, I tested it with the prompt &amp;ldquo;My Bavarian
mother unintentionally takes a selfie with her mobile phone&amp;rdquo;, also
returning me a selection of ethnicities in the results, which are unlikely
to match what I actually want. What a bad user experience!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, Stability AI released Stable Diffusion 3, which the community
had been waiting for in great anticipation. It quickly turned out that this
model is quite useless. The training data only contained a very small
amount of lightly-dressed humans, leading to a total incomprehension of
human anatomy. The prompt &amp;ldquo;woman lying on grass&amp;rdquo; quickly became a meme.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In my last blog post, I showed how I built a pipeline out of several
open source models. This ability is essential for many use cases,
including professional media production and research. It also
supports the creation of an ecosystem of supporting tools (more on this below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The models developed by big Silicon Valley companies like Meta, Google,
and OpenAI don&amp;rsquo;t support such use cases and probably don&amp;rsquo;t even want to;
they are happy if users can modify a video they took in a caf칠 to show a
Kombucha instead of a Coke or an Avocado Toast instead of a Hamburger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An ecosystem of tools around foundation models is critical, because it
allows, among other things, the very precise &lt;em>specification of outputs&lt;/em>.
Simply speaking, one of the most useless ways to specify the image or
video that I want to be generated is by text. Much more useful are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Controlnets:&lt;/em> can specify output by visual constraints (colors, body
poses, depth information, edge information etc.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>IPAdapters:&lt;/em> can be used to transfer non-tangible information, such
as the style of an image&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>LORAs:&lt;/em> a more heavyweight approach than IPAdapters that allows much
more control of styles, materials, and humans in the output&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="2-current-video-models">2. Current Video Models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since my last AI blog post, I consider the most important models that
have been released: LTX-Video (1 month ago), Hunyuan (3 weeks ago), and
many additions to CogVideoX. Their main strengths are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>LTX:&lt;/em> Lightning fast&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>CogVideoX:&lt;/em> Extreme controllability&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Hunyuan:&lt;/em> Best visual quality&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>First, let me show an interactive session of me with &lt;em>LTX video&lt;/em>, captured
in real-time from my screen. The speed is absolutely mind-blowing!&lt;/p>
&lt;video width="720" autoplay loop>
&lt;source src="ltx.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>CogVideoX&lt;/em> family stands out by how many things can be controlled
about the videos that are generated, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Using images to specify the start &amp;amp; end of the video&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Define trajectories of objects in the video&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Exact specification of camera movements&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Using LORAs, we can already specify styles like &amp;ldquo;Disney Movie&amp;rdquo;, with
more coming out on a daily basis&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Using a variety of controlnets&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Video generation with CogVideoX using controlnet (courtesy of &lt;a href="https://github.com/kijai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kijai&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
&lt;video width="720" autoplay loop>
&lt;source src="kijai.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Finally: &lt;em>Hunyuan&lt;/em>. I very quickly got very convinced by it.
Here is the sixth test video that I ever created with it.
The quality is just unbelievable for a quick test video.
As input, I used Huyen&amp;rsquo;s image from Figure 2 piped through an LLM for captioning and motion instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;video width="720" autoplay loop>
&lt;source src="huyen.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;h2 id="3-case-study-ai-remake-of-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">3. Case Study: AI Remake of &amp;ldquo;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of this experiment was to understand Hunyuan capabilities more
deeply. It took 10 intense days from start to finish. It&amp;rsquo;s important to
note that if I had simply wanted to generate the best possible AI video
when I started, I would have used CogVideoX, because of its strong
controllability. And indeed, controllability was the main challenge in
this experiment, as Hunyuan only accepted 2 types of inputs when we
started:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Text prompts&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Videos for specifying motion vectors&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Together with my most artistic PhD student (&lt;a href="https://ar-ai.org/author/david-maruscsak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D치vid Maruscs치k&lt;/a>), we set out
to make a short AI movie with Hunyuan. Our plan of attack was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Model exploration: understand censorship &amp;amp; prompting capabilities&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Creative exploration: which kind of movie can we make given the
technical constraints?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Production&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>A very weird characteristic of Hunyuan is that to get the best outputs,
you can&amp;rsquo;t really use natural language prompts (same issue as for e.g.
Flux or LTX-Video). Instead, you must use an LLM that transforms what
you want into a prompt that suits the model. Tencent very kindly also
released the LLM that they are using for that, but it&amp;rsquo;s VRAM requirement
is 700GB&amp;hellip; To put this in perspective, you would need 44 of the best
consumer graphics cards available right now. It seemed too heavy.
Instead, we used a quantized version of Llama 3.3 that only needs 35GB
VRAM, so it could fit into our H100 card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without LORAs, the standard trick to achieve consistency between shots
is to use celebrities as actors in your AI movie. So, we started by
testing 120 celebrities .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pipeline was fully automatic using Llama and Hunyuan. First, Llama
generated a list of the top-20 celebrities for certain domains (sports,
music, politics, fictional characters, etc.); then, it created a prompt
in the expected format for Hunyuan. We generated four 5-second videos
per celebrity, resulting in 480 clips that D치vid Maruscs치k watched and
rated. The whole process took 8 hours on a single H100 GPU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed with the results, we proceeded to explore different storylines for
our movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="creative-exploration">Creative Exploration&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Our first idea was to remake the arthouse movie &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_and_Cigarettes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coffee and
Cigarettes&lt;/a>. Initial results were very encouraging:&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>However, we quickly realized that with the currently incomplete
ecosystem around Hunyuan, we can only depict 1 celebrity per shot
reliably. In general, the success rate when having 2 goes down dramatically (90% =&amp;gt;
1%).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we had to find a movie genre that mainly shows single actors in
shots, which led us to &amp;ldquo;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on our test, the celebrity that works by far the best among all is
Donald Trump. So, he had to be one of them. I remembered that Donald
Trump had some beef with Taylor Swift (&amp;ldquo;cat lady&amp;rdquo;), so we considered it
to be a good fit to make Taylor &amp;ldquo;The Good&amp;rdquo;, as she kills &amp;ldquo;The Bad&amp;rdquo; at
the end of the movie. We were only left with determining &amp;ldquo;The Ugly&amp;rdquo;.
While Vladimir Putin works very well in Hunyuan and could be a good fit,
we were not too keen to get to experience Novichok agent. So, we settled
for Elon Musk (If you read this Elon: Please don&amp;rsquo;t disable the breaks
while I am driving my car. It is only a joke! Thank you!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="production">Production&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>To be honest, it was a painful process. We had about 20 short shots that
we had to generate. Only very few of them worked through a completely
automated pipeline. For the others, it was more like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Generate 16 clips with automated pipeline (~5 minutes)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look at clips, pick best one, refine prompt&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Goto 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>But, oh boy! When it worked, it worked astonishingly well:&lt;/p>
&lt;video width="720" autoplay loop>
&lt;source src="elon.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>A few clips were completely impossible to generate, as there is a
strange dependency between:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Celebrity in the shot&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activity that the celebrity is doing&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Overall scene&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand this point. Changing a single word in the
prompt can get you from &amp;ldquo;completely unusable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me about 10 hours of work to generate the 20 shots. Finally,
David used his great video editing skills to put everything together.
Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusions&lt;/strong> Hunyuan video demonstrated great potential in this
project. I also had to dive into LLMs (something that I religiously
avoided before that), which was a very interesting experience! I can&amp;rsquo;t
wait for Tencent to release further capabilities for their model (most
importantly: image2video), as well as the open source community creating
more and especially better LORAs (I found the ones that are currently
available to not work very well).&lt;/p>

In this experiment, I wanted to investigate how far you can get by using only open source AI models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the relevance of open source AI models? First, as Yann LeCun and others argue, there are implications on the highest level; AI is becoming an absolute key technology of our times; it can&amp;rsquo;t be good for humanity if this power is in the hand of small group of people leading companies in Silicon Valley and Beijing. Second, there is a technical dimension to it. As we saw with Linux vs. Windows: Open Source leads to technical superiority in the long run. Applied to AI, we could observe that it did not take long for open text-to-image models to overtake closed ones (e.g. Stable Diffusion vs. Midjourney).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following, I describe details of my experiment, which took 10 hours from concept to final cut. You can also skip directly to the end to see the final result.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatic-pipeline">Automatic Pipeline&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As first step, I set up an automatic pipeline to create videos from images. As input images, I used some beautiful nature photographs (links to all used resources at the bottom of this page). Then, I adapted an awesome ComfyUI workflow to run in my environment (A100 with 80GB VRAM). Final computation speed was just below 2 minutes from an image to a video clip consisting of 49 frames (720x480 pixels). One important aspect of this workflow is that while it includes some text-to-image models, it does not require me to enter text prompts in order to get images; I much prefer a completely visual pipeline.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Based on 25 input images, I generated 96 clips in 3 hours, taking just below 2 minutes per clip.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="manual-postprocessing">Manual Postprocessing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Out of the 96 generated clips, about half were sufficiently good. I then picked the 23 I liked best and performed spatio-temporal upscaling in Topaz AI to 1920p resolution at 30 fps. Finally, I quickly arranged the clips in iMovie, together with an audio track from Sir Attenborough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="final-result--conclusions">Final Result &amp;amp; Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The final result is clearly not as good as what can be done with closed source tools (e.g. a recent favorite of mine: &lt;a href="https://x.com/tunguz/status/1832493397694660914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Baie Area&lt;/a>). However, it confirmed my opinion about the trajectory of open source video generation models (I have been testing them all&amp;hellip;): they will overtake closed sourced ones sooner than expected!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also learned more about the limitations of CogVideoX: I did a similar experiment with humans in the input images, but they did not work out well. While camera trajectories and actions in the background worked very well, consistency of humans was lacking.&lt;/p>

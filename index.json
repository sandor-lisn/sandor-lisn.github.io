Surprise: it has already happened!\nIn this lengthy blogpost, I want to:\nExplain the enormous work that we did over the last 10 days, resulting in a funny AI movie (jump to the end if you are only here for that)\nExplain the big picture of generative AI for videos\nTable of Contents 1. The Ideal Video Model 2. Current Video Models 3. Case Study: AI Remake of ‚ÄúThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly‚Äù Since my last blog post, a ton of generative AI video models have been released and I have tested the most important ones. To be upfront with my conclusion: Tencent‚Äôs Hunyuan Video is absolutely astonishing and will have wide impact. The last time I had this feeling was when Stable Diffusion came out in 2022, which was the foundation for successful commercial products such as Midjourney and is still being used widely (e.g. the new Mountain Dew commercials are made with it). I am convinced: Hunyuan will be for video generation what Stable Diffusion has been for image generation.\n1. The Ideal Video Model Obviously, we want video models to be expressive and generate videos of high resolution and framerate. Some not-so-obvious requirements include:\nOpen source: model can be downloaded and run locally\nUncensored: censored models lead to many problems\nAllow the development of an ecosystem of tools around it\nFollowing the analogy to Stable Diffusion I drew earlier: all of these were true for it and were key to why it won.\nModel Censorship In general, this is a difficult question. On the one hand, I concur that some extreme content should simply not exist at all, so models should not be able to generate it. On the other hand, over-censoring of models has some unintended side effects.\nEarlier this year, Google‚Äôs image generation model Gemini was widely ridiculed when a prompt for ‚ÄúNazi soldiers‚Äù would generate Black and Asian soldiers. When OpenAI released DALLE in 2022, I tested it with the prompt ‚ÄúMy Bavarian mother unintentionally takes a selfie with her mobile phone‚Äù, also returning me a selection of ethnicities in the results, which are unlikely to match what I actually want. What a bad user experience!\nThis year, Stability AI released Stable Diffusion 3, which the community had been waiting for in great anticipation. It quickly turned out that this model is quite useless. The training data only contained a very small amount of lightly-dressed humans, leading to a total incomprehension of human anatomy. The prompt ‚Äúwoman lying on grass‚Äù quickly became a meme.\n‚Äò‚ÄòWoman lying on grass‚Äô, according to Stable Diffusion 3 Ecosystem In my last blog post, I showed how I built a pipeline out of several open source models. This ability is essential for many use cases, including professional media production and research. It also supports the creation of an ecosystem of supporting tools (more on this below).\nThe models developed by big Silicon Valley companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI don‚Äôt support such use cases and probably don‚Äôt even want to; they are happy if users can modify a video they took in a caf√© to show a Kombucha instead of a Coke or an Avocado Toast instead of a Hamburger.\nAn ecosystem of tools around foundation models is critical, because it allows, among other things, the very precise specification of outputs. Simply speaking, one of the most useless ways to specify the image or video that I want to be generated is by text. Much more useful are:\nControlnets: can specify output by visual constraints (colors, body poses, depth information, edge information etc.)\nIPAdapters: can be used to transfer non-tangible information, such as the style of an image\nLORAs: a more heavyweight approach than IPAdapters that allows much more control of styles, materials, and humans in the output\nLeft: behind the scenes of a video I posted on Linkedin in 02/2024, using a LORA I had trained on my appearance and a controlnet for body pose. Right: my coworker Huyen, generated using an IPAdapter conditioned with 4 photos of her. 2. Current Video Models Since my last AI blog post, I consider the most important models that have been released: LTX-Video (1 month ago), Hunyuan (3 weeks ago), and many additions to CogVideoX. Their main strengths are:\nLTX: Lightning fast\nCogVideoX: Extreme controllability\nHunyuan: Best visual quality\nFirst, let me show an interactive session of me with LTX video, captured in real-time from my screen. The speed is absolutely mind-blowing!\nThe CogVideoX family stands out by how many things can be controlled about the videos that are generated, including:\nUsing images to specify the start \u0026amp; end of the video\nDefine trajectories of objects in the video\nExact specification of camera movements\nUsing LORAs, we can already specify styles like ‚ÄúDisney Movie‚Äù, with more coming out on a daily basis\nUsing a variety of controlnets\nVideo generation with CogVideoX using controlnet ‚Ä¶","date":1734530400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734530400,"objectID":"9ff72740d9e4801ea9a6229020f0da3f","permalink":"https://drsandor.net/ai/good-bad-ugly/","publishdate":"2024-12-18T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ai/good-bad-ugly/","section":"ai","summary":"This month, a groundbreaking generative AI video model was released.

In this experiment, I wanted to investigate how far you can get by using only open source AI models.\nWhat is the relevance of open source AI models? First, as Yann LeCun and others argue, there are implications on the highest level; AI is becoming an absolute key technology of our times; it can‚Äôt be good for humanity if this power is in the hand of small group of people leading companies in Silicon Valley and Beijing. Second, there is a technical dimension to it. As we saw with Linux vs. Windows: Open Source leads to technical superiority in the long run. Applied to AI, we could observe that it did not take long for open text-to-image models to overtake closed ones (e.g. Stable Diffusion vs. Midjourney).\nIn the following, I describe details of my experiment, which took 10 hours from concept to final cut. You can also skip directly to the end to see the final result.\nAutomatic Pipeline As first step, I set up an automatic pipeline to create videos from images. As input images, I used some beautiful nature photographs (links to all used resources at the bottom of this page). Then, I adapted an awesome ComfyUI workflow to run in my environment (A100 with 80GB VRAM). Final computation speed was just below 2 minutes from an image to a video clip consisting of 49 frames (720x480 pixels). One important aspect of this workflow is that while it includes some text-to-image models, it does not require me to enter text prompts in order to get images; I much prefer a completely visual pipeline.\nBased on 25 input images, I generated 96 clips in 3 hours, taking just below 2 minutes per clip.\nManual Postprocessing Out of the 96 generated clips, about half were sufficiently good. I then picked the 23 I liked best and performed spatio-temporal upscaling in Topaz AI to 1920p resolution at 30 fps. Finally, I quickly arranged the clips in iMovie, together with an audio track from Sir Attenborough.\nFinal Result \u0026amp; Conclusions The final result is clearly not as good as what can be done with closed source tools (e.g. a recent favorite of mine: La Baie Area). However, it confirmed my opinion about the trajectory of open source video generation models (I have been testing them all‚Ä¶): they will overtake closed sourced ones sooner than expected!\nI also learned more about the limitations of CogVideoX: I did a similar experiment with humans in the input images, but they did not work out well. While camera trajectories and actions in the background worked very well, consistency of humans was lacking.\nCredits Audio: David Attenborough - For All Nature (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_dMFnib-s) Wildlife photographs: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-25-breathtaking-images-from-the-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-contest-180983516/ ComfyUI Workflow: https://github.com/henrique-galimberti/i2v-workflow/blob/main/CogVideoX-I2V-workflow_v2.json Models: Florence-2-large Lexi-Llama-3-8B-Uncensored_Q4_K_M.gguf CogVideoX-5b Outpainting: RealVisXL V3.0 Inpainting ","date":1727877600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727877600,"objectID":"2417045f261bda6eaf39256f30365c4d","permalink":"https://drsandor.net/ai/attenborough/","publishdate":"2024-10-02T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ai/attenborough/","section":"ai","summary":"Social media has recently been flooded with impressive AI videos made with closed source tools like Sora, Runway, or Kling.

At the end of July 2024, we showed a demonstration at ACM SIGGRAPH 2024 in Denver for their Real-Time Live! category.\nFirst of all, what is ACM SIGRAPH Real-Time Live? It is a specific category at the premiere computer graphics conference ACM SIGGRAPH. While SIGGRAPH has been running every year since 1974, the Real-Time Live! category (RTL for short) has only been around for 15 years. It is very engaging, as presenters have 6 minutes to show a demonstration of real-time graphics to a large audience of computer graphics professionals (~5000 people). For me, this has always been the most fascinating event of SIGGRAPH, as it shows you the maximum of what‚Äôs possible in real-time graphics today. Also, compared to research papers, you can actually see the inventors demonstrating what they made‚Äî this makes much clearer what really works and what doesn‚Äôt.\nHere are some of my favorites from recent years:\nAI \u0026amp; Physics-Assisted Character Pose Authoring (2022) Bebylon (2018) IQ livecoding with Shadertoy (I can‚Äôt find the video on YouTube; guess it was before they started uploading RTL to YouTube) How did our demo come about? In December 2023, I contacted Matt Swoboda about submitting something to RTL. We were playing with this idea over the last decade, but it never materialized, until this year! Matt quickly brought in a great artist, while I could secure some sponsorship and support from Canon Japan, which led to this amazing constellation:\nBest real-time rendering engine for live events: Notch (Matt is their Co-Founder \u0026amp; CTO) Fantastic audio-visual artist: Brett Bolton (Designer of U2‚Äôs show in the Las Vegas sphere, VJ for the Grateful Dead, etc.) The most stressable AR demo crew: David Maruscsak and me üòä Best AR headset: Canon‚Äôs X1 (Sorry Apple, but you need to work much harder! Even though X1 was released 4 years before your Vision Pro, it has a much better image quality, better co-axial alignment of screens and cameras, better tracking infrastructure, easier integration with custom software, much better weight, etc; let me not even get started about Meta‚Äôs headsets‚Ä¶) What is the concept of our demo? You can watch a concise summary of our concept in the submission video below that we sent to SIGGRAPH. The main feedback that we received from the organizers was that we should expand our demo to have 2 viewers instead of 1 in order to highlight the potential to have visuals interact with multiple viewers in 3D. Challenge accepted!\nWhat could the audience see? Unfortunately, there were several issues with the YouTube stream of the event, so it was much harder for the remote audience to understand what was going on. Let me start by explaining what the audience in the room could see.\nView from stage Audience view of stage Setup details. On the right: stage with Brett playing; behind him traditional audio-reactive visuals; 2 viewers with AR headsets in front of the stage. Left side: split screen, showing the augmented views of the 2 viewers. The setup shown in the above figure was not clear for viewers of the YouTube stream. It did not help that for the first half of our performance, the stream was only showing the view of 1 viewer.\nThe main challenge with our setup was controlling the lighting. Since the sensors are quite sensitive to external lighting (as well as the AR content) we did our best to control this (including working with the Siggraph AV team), but even with our best efforts we had some glitches during the final performance. That said, we still got very nice compliments from the other participants and the audience.\nFinal rehearsal: note the colorful background behind Brett, compared to the black background at the actual performance Final rehearsal: the colorful bright background is very nice, because: it illuminates Brett (2 views on left) and shows off refractions of virtual water (2 views on right) . In the actual performance, we had to switch back to black because of tracking instabilities Showtime! After months of hard work, we were finally ready to demo! The hall filling with the audience was an awe-inspiring moment for me (I estimate about 3500 attendants).\nSelfie just before the start of the show Luckily we were the first team to present, so we could relax afterwards and enjoy the show, which contained some truly remarkable demos, including:\nThe controller for Jim Henson‚Äôs muppets Movin Tracin‚Äô: my personal favorite. I was surprised that this demo did not get any award. Mesh Mortal Combat: winner of both awards (audience \u0026amp; jury). You can also just watch the whole stream, or jump directly to our part.\nConclusions It was a great experience to present at Real-Time Live! I hope to return in coming years!\nWhat we learned from this work is that there is a huge potential for having visuals at live events in AR headsets; we got encouraging feedback at the conference!\nWe also learned that it is very challenging, both in terms of technology, as well as in terms of having a ‚Ä¶","date":1725458400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725458400,"objectID":"1356d87d1d7e708d6d6f69531a527bdf","permalink":"https://drsandor.net/project/rtl/","publishdate":"2024-09-04T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rtl/","section":"project","summary":"July 2024 - A long-time dream of mine came true!
